Its plundering the heavens. Have you read it?&-&Can someone please recommend me some similar novels like plundering the heavens and a will eternal?? 
Plundering the heavens- protagonist is a ruthless op character. He is shameless and scolds abusively. He has a bandit like tendency and loves to steal. He is very cunning.

A will eternal- protagonist never loses and uses every means of despicable ideas to win. Pretty shameless and boasts. Wherever he goes he creates trouble. People get happy when he leaves them and people get headache when he join them.
Both the novels are too funny and lighthearted. please recommend something similar. I shall seal the heavens is also good. But it's a bit serious. But still something similar is also welcome.&-&<@!513605162992926732> oh ok i thought its a chinese novel&-&Perfect World,Warlock of the Magus World, Reverend Insanity&-&No offence but these are not like that.

What are your thoughts on novel with true op protagonist?&-&I read any novel I find interesting enough. Also True OP protag novels are good only if they something to balance it with like A-grade story telling or Good Side Characters and character development or World Builiding. If the novel has a op protag but no balance with a counterpart then that novel just becomes a lame piece of shit.


A good example of True op protag novel is Emperor's Domination(Truly OP protag, Awesome WorldBuilding and Nice Side Characters even tho he keeps changing them but all side characters have developments)&-&A bad example of op protag novels is **The end of the magic era**(the protag just keeps on faceslaping others and we don't get to know his thoughts at all instead we get shitty side characters monologuing about how great the mc is and how amazed they are, this goes on for all of the novel)&-&That's absolutely right. One dimensional world and characters really make a light novel shitty. Antagonists never really understand real situation and side characters flip from " He is so arrogant doesn't know how high blah blah" to " Wow how talented he is." That's really a  big side effects in many Chinese novels.&-&But my point is many people complaints about op mc novels. Op doesn't mean talented mc. Op means who always get ahead of others and never loses or rarley loses. I really hate those pitiful japanese mc like character wo doesn't have balls to be a man. I really don't understand the reason behind those people. If you are in a world like ' in another world with my smartphone' , you can expect that type of mc. But in xianxia type evil world how can you even reason to find a girlish mc.&-&I've seen a lot of good concepts being ruined by this&-&Those wimpy type of MC that just passively approaches any problems&-&Anyway I don't wish to deteriorate my mood any further. Imma go back to read Lord of the Mysteries&-&Ha ha ha&-&By the way it's really sad that lord of mysteries manga is just in its early stage&-&Read the novel&-&<@556157454623309835> can you recommend me some light novel like emperor domination?  I have read one which is exact copy like that. But I want more. The mc should be the most powerful and arrogant and can bully anyone like that novel&-&But not like peerless martial god. It's a bit serious to read&-&<@513605162992926732> I can only remember some of them like 
*Sovereign of three realms*
*Man Huang Feng Bao*
*Dragon Marked War God*&-&But they are not as good as ED&-&Which one did u read that is similar to ED?&-&Thanks for the recommendation. I will certainly try the two as I have already read dragon marked war god&-&By the way I was talking about ' Alchemy emperor of the divine dao '. Its not entirely like emperor domination. But most parts are almost same.&-&Ah.. now that u mention it I remember it. I had tried reading it but gave up after he started to focus on combat power rather alchemy&-&And story was getting cliched as well&-&Right&-&<@513605162992926732> try Library of Heavens Path&-&It's slow&-&Excruciatingly slow&-&He wanted a stupidly op mc who never loses&-&So&-&Yea well that's true i guess&-&<@594276279038246927> thanks bro . I have already read it. It's really good. But I really don't like teacher part. Cos most of the time he made arrogant people his friends through teaching. And the most important part is they don't ask for it, but the protagonist offer his help shamelessly&-&Guys have you read " way of the devil" ?

I dropped it after 150&-&Yah. But it will get interesting. Cos no side characters are going to stay with him for long. This novel is all about how mc is going to get more power and becoming close to those godly race. I think there is also a secret behind mc's birth or something. The most important thing is that this novel is not like normal Chinese novel where the same sequence repeats everytime(like mc become powerful and move to new place and becomes weak again). Here the difference between mc and upper realm is really vast and mc is closing that difference beautifully&-&By the way have you guys ever written any light novel or fanfic?&-&Ok I'll see some spoilers for reference then try again&-&World defying dan god is really good ehehehe&-&Ye those two sisters are hot and fricking helm every single female in that novel is hot&-&Yall know where i can read past chapter 300 of reincarnated as a dragons egg?

Hmmm
How about adventure plus magic, wizardry with some warrior stuff&-&I suggest **Advent of the Archmage**, **The Book eating Magician**, **Lord of the Mysteries**(this one has a lot of mysteries but also a good amount of combat just not martial arts styled), **Abuse of Magic**, **Trafford's Trading Club**, **Gourmet of Another World**, **Chrysalis**&-&U can check these out&-&All of them have adventuring but some of them have martial arts(physical fighting) parts as well&-&Thx&-&<@556157454623309835> hey why didn't you recommend me that?

Can you recommend me something like that, which is light and simple?&-&**Abuse of Magic** light and simple with op mc(but the starting has quite a bit of slavery(not too violent tho))
**Sovereign of Judgement** op mc with a vendetta&-&**Supreme Magus** op mc but he has a tragic past&-&**The Legendary Mechanic** he's pretty op and tanky&-&**Gourmet of Another World** mc not too op but his system op af. Also the food&-&<@513605162992926732>&-&I didn't rec u Book Eating Magician because u said op mc but he almost gets rekt by the other sins&-&And if u want op mcs then try Toika's works such as Everyone else is a Returnee, Infinte Dungeon Competitive  Society, I Reincarnated for nothing, Stop Friendly Fire.

Its pretty great as expected from Ryohgo Narita 


My only complain is the new main characters
I know they suppose to be the second version of izaya, shizuo, and shinra
My problem is they are too much on the spotlight. A lot of us love Durarara because there's no main character some of you might say its Mikado and his friends is the main characters, ye you're right but wrong at the same time. 

You see its not focus on them but on the city itself. But unlike this new series SH. 70% of the story is mostly focus on this three or you can say Yahiro our new mc. Let say it had a 5 chapters in one volume, that 4 chapters is about Yahiro literally beating anyone and that one chapter left is about the old characters

You didn't find any problem about it? 

Well for me its boring. ofc I didn't mean the whole series itself but the character balance I love so much on Durarara series is gone now.

I forgot to mention how overpowered this new mc that's why the plot is too predictable now, unlike the old Durarara that can make me excited just by thinking what's going to happen next

I might have judge it too early because I haven't read the volume 4 yet. But this is what I think honestly.
 Overall its pretty great. If you love Durarara series give it a try&-&<@563308156235546654>  Han xiao and feidin just fucked the arcane church forces lol&-&Indeed&-&Flickering world really was a hype&-&I guess its gonna cool down for a while&-&I meant the novel&-&Maybe&-&According to what I kno, He will fight ||Ames soon, no idea why and then kill Esgod soon||&-&weird novel...&-&Which one?&-&Kujibiki Tokushou: Musou HƒÅremu ken&-&it's harem novel&-&Oh&-&<a:YGkonosubadance4:663881755648065558> <a:YGkonosubadance3:663881131447549952> <a:YGkonosubadance2:663886023834468352> <a:YGkonosubadance1:663881116117237770>&-&I need a novel&-&Paragon of Sin&-&Universe's ultimate boss&-&<a:owoSpin:587930886260129802>&-&***stop flexing***&-&<:YGeww:650261595749875742>&-&Why&-&<a:nekoexcited:575326461783834635>&-&Keep flexing&-&<:YGmeguminok:650310495709954088>&-&they're not even 200 chapters&-&No problem both have a long chapters&-&Buth are fun&-&Just give them a read&-&<@!556157454623309835> potato fries&-&<:YGLewd:650261871923953673>&-&<a:YGtriggered:663876764556066816>&-&can i peel you?&-&<a:YGinsane:663876785275928599>&-&No&-&tch nitro&-&<:YGShrug:661340423679377454>&-&<a:owoSpin:587930886260129802>&-&owo im watching national geographical documentary&-&Lol&-&Which documentary?&-&japan secret water garden&-&Lol&-&<a:YGrainbowHbang:663876624017653800>&-&<@!556157454623309835> smiley, have you read reverend insanity??????&-&Yes&-&Not all the way tho&-&I dropped around 500&-&awwwwwwwww&-&why?&-&i just finished the part where ning bing betrays the mc&-&is it not good after wards???&-&Well I got bored from  it&-&Is there any good anime fan fic?&-&***Finally!!!***&-&A tarot gathering!&-&<a:YGrainbowHbang:663876624017653800> <a:owoSpin:587930886260129802>&-&Poor little psy-psy&-&Very Pure and Ambiguous The Prequel&-&this is good&-&<:istare:716577407884066816> <:watch_the_Chaos:680112804229021707>&-&i have read reverend insanity till chap 550&-&this ma hong yun guy really is annoying&-&i will drop it for now&-&got anything else for me?&-&smiley?&-&<:YGthink:663874183905804288>&-&Dual Cultivation&-&Great ecchi novel&-&Pocket hunting dimension

They thought he was another simple b rank and they could get rid of him easily. Get the rank a skill from him and reach A rank themselves,  so they used their connections to force an unknown B rank to a death match. Our MC is also at fault for not doing much, (which is author's fault). Then MC kills guy easily and his father the admiral gets enraged at his son's death in front of him.&-&That's where nef kinda ragequit it seems, coz if he had read a bit more then he would know that ||MC survives the admiral's offence, the vice admirals helper Rank A arrives and puts an end to the rage of admiral.

¬†It is an analogy of a family and an expression implies intimacy.

Just want to clarify, we rarely use Âºü(younger brother) or Â¶π(younger sister) to refer to someone. If he or she is younger than me or almost the same age as me, I would just use their given name. For classmates, they are usually the same age as me, so I would call their given name.

Addressing someone as Âì• (elder brother) or Âßê Ôºàelder sister) is an indication of our respect. One of our most impotant society ethics is the younger should respect the elder and the elder should look after the younger. So we often use this for asking help, even when this person is a totally stranger.&-&The implications are most of the time lost in translation&-&Leaving us in confusion&-&I know&-&we have same thing here&-&even if you don't know someone if that person's age is older than you&-&then you call that person older brother/older sister&-&if they're older than you a few generations then aunt/uncle&-&is the thing of calling older brother/sister as a form of respect everywhere in asia?&-&i thought it was only a unique trait to the novels.&-&and smiley, how come you are so knowledgeable in this aspect?&-&I don't know it might be asian culture&-&It is actually prominent only in asian culture.

A fast pass is given daily as login bonus, one by power stone voting and one by energy stone voting.
Fast pass can be used to unlock any one chapter no matter how long that chapter is or how expensive that chapter is.&-&So u can read 3 chapters for free daily by using fast passes and after that u have to buy coins(spirit stones) to read more
But coins can also be earned by inviting new users to webnovel.
Or redeeming a code that webnovel releases on it's fb and instagram accounts&-&U can make several accounts tho.

> 1. Your MC is edgy asf. (now I know why you keep mentioning goblin slayer and shield hero because almost half of his personality is borrowed to them)
He is like that for reasons I put lots of effort into "justifying". ||As you read, he wasn't always like that. He was more of a frail, innocent and anti-social child who was trying to find a better life. But when his one and only friend turned against him and got the entire city to do so as well, he went through a change that you see in present Kurogane. Although despising people, he took it upon himself that this was something he deserved, thus he gave up on pursuing an actual life and instead, did what was neccesary to stay alive since he knew his mother would have wanted that.|| Though, I can understand if you didn't "feel" everything I just explained, or at least enough. As much as I tried to get this message across, I can still see how someone wouldn't pick this up as they read. So I understand.&-&> 2. Vague Explanation. Looks like this world have magic on it and your MC just keep using spells with shadow shadow thingy its like he's trying to slap in our face that he is a cool blacky dude. Back to the subject. Your magic spells might sound cool to you but for us even you use some complicated words to make it look cool we won't understand a single thing without what it do
Well, in this case I wanted to start off by "showing more than telling". I do plan on expanding a lot on this, but I felt that I should not do this from the get-go. I don't want to force this down the reader but rather, little by little after some exposure. But this will be heavily expanded on from Volume 2. I already started it with a full outline complete. And hey, other fantasies use words from languages we don't even understand. The language for spells I used are heavily based off video game spells you see in MOBA's/RPG's/MMO - not to mention that I explain what the spells do to the opponents in the scene. What exactly am I missing that makes me look like I'm slapping spells in readers faces? Specifics would help me understand, if you don't mind ^-^&-&> 3. The World Building. Ye maybe its too early to complain about this since its only first vol but the world building is pretty vague
> Looks like you have some map planned for your world so I'm expecting some explanation soon
Yup, already planned through Volume 2 - through more showing, and much more telling as well. I only gave smaller bits to once again take it slow and not dump it upon the readers.

> 4 The Plot. First about how the people misunderstood him as a killer its obvious that you're trying to make your mc an outcast type then make friends as the story progress and that's exactly what happens
Yup, exactly. People like these stories, don't they? Watching an MC break his limits and push past his insecurities.

> 5. Class, & Adventurers Explanation. I want you to do a better job at explaining this shits because it's pretty important
> All I see is rouge, slayer, etc I won't ask you to change it but at least you should explain what they do or what kind of fighter they are when they have those class
Again, I want to show it and tell it as the MC experiences these types of classes. We get a glimpse of a Pugilist, Slayer and Rogue with some detail as to what they excel and struggle on. ||For example, remember what Daisuke told Kurogane about a rogue's flaws the one night?|| But yea, I should improve this more. You're right.&-&> 6. Main Heroine Hikari. Ok i surprisingly like Hikari I'm expecting her to be the cool type but I'm wrong well its ok to stay like this
> Cause if her personality is like that her relationship with the mc will not progress
Right, I did this on purpose. ||I want her to understand that if she wants to win Kurogane's heart, she will have to do a lot more than she can imagine to climb over the scars of his past and present suffering. I made him explode on her at the end to emphasize this very point.||

> 7. Weapons. Hikari is the most normal looking weapon among them. As for the mc's sword. It's pretty edgy tbh
> A 'slayer' class using a hero looking sword. Pretty edgy
Well, it's a dagger - a stock kind for a classic rogue. I plan on having them improve their skills and equipment as they develop. I didn't want to start with overly nice looking gear if they're still in need of training which will occur in V2

And I don't see how a broadsword isn't suitable for a slayer. ||Either way, his sword broke at the end so don't worry about that blade, lol.||&-&> 8. Characters. I don't really like how you're stuck only on those characters. Why not create a a large amount of characters because all of the characters that mc met besides that old man, Hikari, daisuke gives an aura that they are nothing but mob characters
If I added more characters than there are right now, then it would push his whole skeptical personality of not trusting anyone and not wanting to do with anyone. When I say this, I only mean it for Volume 1, as there are **at least** 3 more characters planned for the main cast. I will bring them in slowly. It's upsetting that only Reo was a solid character to you, perhaps there is quite some work left to do with the other 2.

Also, I had no idea who Moona was until now. My, what a beauty. I do see some Hikari in her, too. I appreciate the compliments ^-^

But to wrap it up, I'm sorry this book wasn't to your liking. I took up a good amount of your time only to create dissapointment. I'm eternally grateful that you read through the entire thing. Your thoughts helped me so much and I can use this to get better, especially from someone who's read so much

I did take inspirations from other series, but I did what I could to execute a story better and to give each something to stand out with. Still far from where I need to be, it's clear. But thank you once again for giving time to someone like myself. ‚ô•Ô∏è&-&Nah I'm not exactly disappointed
You did I pretty great job tbh
I guaranteed that you will improve from time to time
And im not exactly the one who act high and mighty since I have no achievements worth mentioning compare to you
I just review it like I did to any other series 
Good Luck <@227116439494983681>

I'll still be around since this is a nice server. Plus, others will be reading it (i think?). 

It's not about accomplishments, since that plays no factor when a reader buys a book to dedicate their time into. Lots of what you said had a good point to it, so once again I'm so appreciative of your thoughts. ^-^

My word.&-&Today has been a strange day.

And left me in tears.
I didn't think she'd actually like what I wrote
And now, YenPress, the main people who are responsible for the official translations of almost all of your Light Novels, is going to see it

I must send him back to the place where he belongs.
If I don‚Äôt do so, then a second or third victim will arise.
That much at least must be avoided.
Kiyotaka Ayanok≈çji, standing right there in front of me, stared directly into my eyes.
If I was to end it all‚ÄîI would do it right here, right now.
And then I‚Äôll be able to proceed to the next step.

I fell asleep early, but woke up in the middle of the night.
The outside that could be seen through the gaps in the mesh fabric was pitch black, and I could barely see what was directly in front of me.
All I could hear were the sounds of insects buzzing and the sound of something running through the grass.
When it came to camping in the deep woods, it was a battle against solitude.
It was a pretty harsh environment for individual female student groups like Horikita or Ibuki.
Even preparing a toilet to use was a hassle.```&-&Kiyo horikita kouenji ibuki kitou that girl.&-&I stop there&-&Who's 2 more&-&Will continue later&-&Idk I haven't read this far&-&Maybe 2st page of chapter 3&-&2&-&Not 3 sorry&-&Ayanokouji only have 3points&-&Lol&-&Lol&-&Thanks for spoiling baka&-&No it's not finish yet&-&I'll read now a bit then sleep.&-&He said he will start gathering points tommorow&-&O&-&<:YGhimezzzz:783381570543288371>&-&I thought he'd keep low profile&-&Then gather point after 12th date&-&Nah its hard keeping a low profile on that test&-&Yeah I thought that's why&-&But ye I think koenji will win this&-&Kouenji can but I want 3rd year&-&Koenji is the TRUE main protagonist after all&-&Don't underestimate 3rd year&-&Lmao&-&<:YGsayalol:783407827175473182>&-&Yeah prly after kiyo expelled he'll go rescue after graduation?&-&Or something&-&<:YGFBKsip:783311059540770846>&-&Ye koenji will get ayanokouji's tools...I meant harem too&-&Lol&-&And sadly I don't think Ayanokouji x Horikita is possible now

A-Anime‚Ä¶? The first question immediately began showing without giving my mind any time to process the letters that filled up my tablet screen.
‚Äú‚Ä¶What is this?‚Äù
I couldn‚Äôt help but blurt out something to myself.
It was obvious from the genre and the question that the quiz was anime-related, but I had no idea what the answer was.```&-&Lol ayanokouji you're an idiot&-&I know you can solve those complicated blah blah maths but I guess your IQ is not enough being cultured&-&<:YGsayalol:783407827175473182> <:YGsayalol:783407827175473182>&-&<@323436713689088002>&-&```Kazoumi Housen, a Class 1-D student who treated Sudou‚Äôs heroine, Horikita, without any mercy.

When I called out only her name, Kei, whose lips were slightly pursed in disapproval, looked at me.
I moved my face closer at the right moment and leaned towards her.
I wonder if it was less than a second before our lips touched.
The first time I had ever felt the lips of the opposite sex- they were much softer than I had imagined.
‚ÄúW-What?‚Äù
Kei, who still didn‚Äôt understand the situation, let out a somewhat dumbfounded voice.
I would have liked to enjoy it for a while longer, but I was in the middle of a deserted island test.
It‚Äôs a wonder no other students happened to be walking by.
‚ÄúWait, I-I-I just kissed you. Huh? What?‚Äù
‚ÄúCan you trust me?‚Äù
When I asked that, Kei shook her head back and forth repeatedly, like a doll.```&-&<@323436713689088002> ***THIS IS LEWD!!!***&-&<:YGLewd:650261871923953673>&-&*sigh*&-&And here this boy just keeps spoiling me&-&Baka&-&**Chapter 6

‚ÄúWell, you‚Äôre right.‚Äù
The guy that Ryuuen is referring to is Koenji.
Despite being alone like me, he was currently in the top 4. Even among the top 10, he was the one who had received the most rank points. He continued to accumulate a huge amount of points from tasks, and his total points numbered 126. They‚Äôre excellent results that didn‚Äôt show any weaknesses.```&-&Teach me reading faster&-&<@323436713689088002> told ya

‚ÄúAnd I would like to pay tribute to the insight and physical prowess you showed from time to time.‚Äù
‚ÄúI don‚Äôt remember doing anything special.‚Äù
‚ÄúIf so, wouldn‚Äôt that be even more amazing?‚Äù
Nanase was praising me, but her facial expression wasn‚Äôt conveying the same thing.
‚ÄúBut Ayanokouji-senpai, you‚Äôre not someone who should be in this school.‚Äù
This was where the atmosphere changed. Obviously, this was different from Nanase‚Äôs familiar calm tone.
‚ÄúCan I hear your reasons as to why I shouldn‚Äôt be here?‚Äù
After nodding once, Nanase slowly stood up and looked back at me.
‚ÄúThat‚Äôs because you‚Äôre from the White Room.‚Äù
This was where the word ‚ÄúWhite Room‚Äù finally popped up from a third party.```&-&```My arm overtook Nanase‚Äôs as if to cross it, and placed a direct strike in front of me.
My tightly gripped fist stopped just a centimeter before it touched Nanase‚Äôs eyes.
‚ÄúHuh!‚Äù
Her body unconsciously stiffened at the impending impact due to every human‚Äôs instinctual kinetic vision.
‚ÄúThat‚Äôs the first strike.‚Äù
Had I really connected it, the current blow would have completely settled this matter.
Her consciousness was blown away in an instant, and Nanase had no choice but to collapse in the spot.```&-&*this is COTE, right?*&-&üëÄ&-&i donno wut the hell's happening, but i'm interested&-&<@!585644054352756741>

SPOIL ME!&-&if zinx doesn't want spoil, then gib it to me! <:YGPansySmile:650243647568347136>&-&Well we're using the title "brocon" on her as a joke but it's not really the brocon you expect it to be
She just idolize her big brother too much. She copy the way he acts, looks, personality, etc
And her big brother doesn't like that about her
She is smart why copy her brother. The brother wants her to decide for herself because all of her actions is just an act to be like him&-&Well nothing really special happened
She join student council cause ayanokouji order her
Her brother graduated and finally learn to decide for herself&-&Tbh I started liking her again&-&She doesn't appear too much in this arc tho&-&i know i know, even i know her title as a brocon is a joke
just said cuz' you know, smol hostility on it (lol jk.) <:YGsayalol:783407827175473182>&-&Seeing both in the anime and LN (I stopped at VL.5, sry) i know it isn't that kind of *Brocon*&-&that's.... kinda nice to here now for me&-&then, how about that two-ego'ed bitch girl?&-&üëÄ&-&Oh you meant kushida
She still have a lot roles here&-&I mean in the latest vol she got beaten up by 1st year
Bitch vs Bitch&-&*ehehehe, serves her right..*&-&***cough**&-&I mean, damn...&-&wut series is this? <:YGthink:663874183905804288>&-&**Rokujouma no Shinryakusha!?**&-&I believe I post this name a lot but nvm&-&<:YGpsychosmile:783390677454422026>&-&wait wait, not familiar with the japanese name&-&it feels like i've seen the name here before&-&**Invaders of the Rokujouma**&-&ohh&-&oh yah&-&i forgot&-&sorry&-&lol&-&i'm familiar calling the series "Invaders"&-&hmmm...........&-&*now i 'm feeling like wanting to download and read it*&-&It's on the pin&-&got bored at the low-teir char. something-something one&-&nah it's ok, i have my own link&-&I didn't even recommend you that lol&-&i already *did* download it, just deleted it cuz to lazy to read all of it&-&yah, that's the funny part <:YGsayalol:783407827175473182>&-&Reminder:
Download Jnovels club version of Rokujouma&-&it was purely coincidence, but since you recommended it to others, i might as well try it&-&.... but vol.2 i'm getting bored&-&I recommend otonari no tenshi and bottom tier on <@775688213569601588>&-&yah&-&What I recommend to you is otonari no tenshi&-&you saw it&-&un&-&*i haven't seen otonari yet*&-&I think you might like rokujouma but since you said you don't like long so I didn't&-&rokujouma is great, donno why i'm lazy to read it&-&*but got hyped reading smartphone*&-&me and my brain&-&<:YGkillself:663874233390071816>&-&Really we're the opposite when it comes to that
Im kinda lazy to read smartphone isekai
While you're lazy to read Rokujouma&-&<:YGsayalol:783407827175473182> <:YGsayalol:783407827175473182>&-&when i downloaded it and ended up having 30 volumes i was like "yow.... can i even survive?"&-&then later on it was just stuck on my drive for months&-&then i ended up deleting it to free up space&-&Me in Rokujouma: "this is some boring cliche harem again man"
Me at Vol 10: "........bruh"&-&Tbh Im planing only reading what the anime covers&-&nvm&-&Before I knew it 
I'm reading past to it&-&hmm&-&Only on rare case I don't usually do it&-&might try it again then&-&<@565072877527891988> if you want to start after the anime
Start from Vol 7&-&eh?&-&it wasn't 6?&-&Then Vol 7.5, Vol 8.5, then Vol 8&-&<:YGainani:663873985112440843>&-&The anime ends there&-&ohh&-&i'll just read it from the start, i've completely forgotten the story anyways&-&all i remember is that it's good&-&Lol well it is good&-&The anime force me to read it after all&-&is it an accurate adapt? or did the anime filtered/altered/removed something?&-&*cuz i still don't like on what they did on vol.12 of DAL. those bastards destroyed that beautiful and improtant volume on the anime*&-&Well in short
There's a high school boy finding a cheap apartment to live in 
But that apartment have some mysterious strong powers
So invaders from different species and planet came to own that apartment
But our mc is not willing to give it up.....it is cheap after all lol&-&Ofc not exactly but the anime did a great job if you ask me
It sells me to the series after all&-&hhmm.. i see&-&welp, that's it, i made up my mind, i'll read it, then when i reached vol.10 i'll read the otonari one&-&it only has two volumes, right? Otonari&-&Actually I'm not really expecting anything from rokujouma from the start
I think that "oh ye ye he will make this girls part of his harem then the end"
But I'm wrong it's consist a lot of plot twist&-&Ye&-&probably because why i hesitated on reading it back then because i'm afraid i won't be reading more because i'll be stuck on a single series for a long time. Now that i don't have anything in mind, this'll be perfect.&-&Well if you want quick
Anime then vol 7&-&it's an easy-going type if i remember, right? then don't really expect anything from it. I've seen so many easy-going type harems and majorities are just like that. But who knows......... right? it has tons of volumes, anything can happen.&-&nice, thanks&-&<:YGsayalol:783407827175473182>&-&*looks like my link is broken*&-&<:YGkanonCry:783311332543430676>&-&Ye I think so too
When I watch/read a trashy show
"Wtf this series have 20+,30+ volumes despite being suck"
But that's exactly whats hyping me
It makes me wonder "I wonder how it will turn this suck series into a great one"&-&> **Rokujouma no Shinryakusha!?**
