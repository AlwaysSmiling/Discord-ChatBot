# Discord-ChatBot
A Discord ChatBot made using Discord.py and Chatterbot


The Bot can be trained in two ways, by using the chatterbot corpus and by using a List in which every next entry represents the steps of a conversation. 


To run the bot, add your Discord Bot Token in place of TOKEN in main.py. 
and execute the run() function after importing main in an interactive window.
