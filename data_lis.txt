Let’s return to you and your struggles. You said you fear oblivion?” “I did,” Augustus answered. Patrick seemed lost. “Would,uh, would anyone like to speak to that?” I hadn’t been in proper school in three years. My parents were my two best friends. My third best friend was an author who did not know I existed. I was a fairly shy person—not the hand-raising type. And yet, just this once, I decided to speak. I half raised my hand and Patrick, his delight evident, immediately said, “Hazel!” I was, I’m sure he assumed, opening up. Becoming Part Of The Group. I looked over at Augustus Waters, who looked back at me. You could almost see through his eyes they were so blue. “There will come a time,” I said, “when all of us are dead. All of us. There will come a time when there are nohuman beings remaining to remember that anyone ever existed or that our species ever did anything. There will be no one left to remember Aristotle or Cleopatra, let alone you. Everything that we did and built and wrote and thought and discovered will be forgotten and all of this”—I gestured encompassingly—“will have been for naught. Maybe that time is coming soon and maybe it is millions of years away, but even if we survive the collapse of our sun, we will not survive forever. There was time before organisms experienced consciousness, and there will be time after. And if the inevitability of human oblivion worries you, I encourage you to&-&ignore it.

Zinx is obsessed with Akari-chan as usual. So he confesses every day.
Rai is always immersed in manga but we love him.
Allen and Akari-chan are always fighting.
Agrou is a good boy really but he stays with us.
Me, MU, Smiley and Yuji are adults of the group.
I'm the joker who always teases everybody. Especially MU.

So let's say I'm in space without space suit.
You are half right. Our body is maintained by atmospheric pressure. 
Space doesn't have it so the boiling point of fluids in my body decreases exponentially.
My body starts to expand. If I hold my breath then my lungs will rupture due to air expanding in them.

While it's true that fluids start to boil my blood will not be totally evaporated.
Also my skin is way too stretchy that it will contain everything within me.

I will swell up but not to the size of a balloon. UV rays will give me a horrible burn and I will die in a couple of minutes.&-&As for my corpse. If my body is near a source of heat then it will mummify. I don't know what it means but I assume it will shrivel up.

If there is no heat source then I will freeze up. As there is no atmosphere, my body won't rot for a long long time.

We shockingly found out we have a non virgin weeb amongst us.
People's opinions regarding it are varied.
Then the conversation following the revelation lead up to Phoon-dono having a full fledged coitus.
Here opinions are mostly expected.
During the said talks even more surprisingly Rai revealed he has a teenage parent friend.
I'm still shocked. 

Now the headline of today:

But that doesn't change the fact to her personality&-&Well yes and theres nothing wrong with people liking characters like that. Its completely subjective&-&Well I understand your reasoning but yeah I hate her that is. END&-&And i respect your opinion but do you really care about healing peoples arms?&-&Yeah of course if she/he important to me 
But of course she loves that boy that much so she became Magical girl
But what I hate about her is the process she go through while doing that 
And after healing his arm a tiny regret of not wishing a bigger one is still in her&-&That's why she became a witch in the first place anyway&-&That argument could be applied to real life people&-&If I'm her I won't heal a fcking boy who just care about violin&-&Why do I care&-&Um pay attention to the anime again people in real life would heal their loved ones and let them do they want to find hapiness.&-&Her act of saving everyone is really admirable but her personality while doing that is shit&-&She's really arrogant bastard&-&Watch the movies and different timeline of her is the same because of her personality&-&She received that tragedy because of her own doing&-&theres nothing wrong with a personality like that&-&And who wouldn’t, if they witnessed what she had witnessed? Again, this is part of her self-esteem issues, and it shows that she’s feeling unloved and lonely. She wanted to be seen as worthy and useful, and because she’s not, she’s slowly breaking down. This is a very tragic part of her story, the way she starts lashing out at everyone as she slowly breaks down up until she turns into a witch. She’s also affected by watching Mami getting eaten and realizing that she’s pretty much a ‘zombie’, because her body is no more than an empty shell. Being a magical girl is taking its toll on her emotions, and is slowly eating away at her. Because she feels like she’s not getting any good from everything that she’s done, her self-esteem becomes even more damaged and she starts lashing out at her friends out of anger, frustration, and sadness.
I think that’s very realistic, and that’s what makes her a very well-written character. Not all characters have to be stoic and emotionless people who rarely cry or have self-esteem issues.&-&Yeah the one who bought her tragedy is herself so she had no right to feel regret&-&Let say lelouch he plan all of his tragedy
But did he regret it&-&If that's her point of view I might like her&-&She's not the only magical girl that's what I'm trying to say&-&Thats a halariously dumb arguemnt smh&-&She even misunderstood the others that what they doing is bad and she just the right one out of all Magical girls&-&Bruh really&-&Arrogant Level 1000000&-&Well she didnt know much so what did you expect lol?&-&Yeah she's at fault
Some random talking animal appear to you and offer you some magic wand and you just yeah I'm the only right Magical girl here&-&Bruh&-&A 5 yrs old might think that&-&And every girl makes their own mistakes and people in real life half self isteem issues. So the arguemnt is basically a typical hater in a nutshell. Lol&-&Yeah I'm not saying I'm better than her
She's really admirable doing it for others
But I'm not that arrogant to think myself highly that can save anyone I might save 1 or 2 ppl but I'm not arrogant that can save a whole country&-&So cya&-&<:YGroger:660741300554825748>&-&Nice argument bud&-&Thats all you have to say just end it with a cee ya? Well that  exmaple you said wont prove your bravery becuase you might make the same mistake also&-&She is not a bitch. Yes, she may be a little bit of an idiot, but that’s because she’s in middle school! She’s young, and she makes mistakes, like all of us. That’s what makes her realistic. Just because she made her wish to heal Kyousuke’s hand, doesn’t mean that she’s an idiot. If you hate her because she likes Kyousuke, then that’s extremely petty and misogynistic, and it completely overlooks her as a whole. Her breakdown in episode 8 is when she realizes that there’s no such thing as a completely selfless wish, and that she was naive for believing so. And as for her being a ‘bitch’? Yeah, that was because she was going through a lot of stress and emotional trauma. She feels worthless and useless, and her acting ‘bitchy’ is perfectly justified.&-&sigh&-&order in the court&-&Just got into a dumb argument&-&My schedule got ruin because of dumb argument lmao&-&<:YGkillself:663874233390071816>&-&Well **FRUIT BASKET S2 TIME**&-&<:YGLewd:650261871923953673>&-&hmm&-&sleep time&-&<@585644054352756741> season 2 is starting today???&-&<:YGPansySmile:650243647568347136>&-&Finally I'll be able to see fruits basket season 2 in August&-&hmmm&-&spring animes&-&<:GWlovTogaLove:389446879919996929>&-&Yeah S2 today&-&Vote For K-On And We're Done Here&-&<@557168803293691937>&-&<@557168803293691937>&-&<@557168803293691937>&-&<:YGpingu:650262009073631253>&-&The hell Zinx??&-&<@641363542364127232>  henlo&-&<:YGwave:651835889558749226>&-&Zinxu&-&kirito kiri**GAY*a&-&Geh&-&<:GWomoRaphiWink:405784197559615510>&-&you lolicon&-&btw whatever you do here, don't talk to this geh  <@557168803293691937>&-&like ever&-&or he'll bore you to death&-&OwO&-&Let them find it out by themselves&-&<:YGchocolasmug:663873901411041312>&-&kiri ignoring me&-&<:GWfateeNeroCry:393461905265786880>&-&<@!323436713689088002>  geh&-&I’m here&-&no I'm not&-&baka&-&<:YGFyou:650261820526821386>&-&U even hv a role of geh&-&<:ASfu:584235112401600531>&-&rhhh&-&ehhh&-&that's bully&-&our owner bully&-&<:GWcorsairBully:399930787711156225>&-&i vote k on allen&-&Thanks  <@561472095490408458>&-&See Kou is nice&-&Tf&-&<:YGkillself:663874233390071816>&-&Like hell&-&dw kiri feel free to release your bad side here&-&dw we won't call FBI&-&Feel free to roast this  @zinx|ice#2956&-&ehh&-&<@641363542364127232> I like you&-&You better stay here&-&learn to ping me properly then try roasting&-&And bully Zinx&-&of course you'd like him&-&Hahaa&-&Lol&-&you both like same age go date or something&-&Tf&-&Did you know Zinx here is a big stalker&-&also same country so it's easy for you 2&-&He’s a stalker huh&-&I see&-&So be careful&-&oi I'm not stalker&-&He even stalks boys&-&Coz he's geh&-&Damn nice game&-&I can already see that kiri and sanj doing lood things inside Taj Mahal&-&18+ CG im coming&-&<@641363542364127232> where you from?&-&don't answer&-&I’m from India ..currently in Ukraine&-&he gonna stalk&-&<:ES_ehhh:658370117192777728>&-&<@585644054352756741> post it in <#650195004165324844>  please&-&now you digged your own grave&-&I'm from India as well&-&Yeah if I unlock it&-&Oooh nice&-&There are three people from India here now&-&I'mma fck them one by one later&-&We are in majority&-&Oooh I see&-&<:YGLewd:650261871923953673> <:YGLewd:650261871923953673>&-&Lol&-&Alleny I don't give permission&-&Let's push guys like Zinx down the hierarchy&-&Hahaaa&-&Geh&-&Geh&-&<:YGbaka:650256683993661471>&-&Tsun&-&no it's not geh&-&Maso&-&Geh&-&Indeed&-&<a:AMbochiNods:642951659630231563>&-&ehh&-&See how disgusting this server

That's what Zinx is&-&It's not a secret that Shinji and the rest of the cast of Evangelion have problems. Personally i believe that people don't like Shinji due to the fact that they can't relate to him or that they expect a main character to be a strong person. He may run away but he always comes back. If you read my first blog about my top 10 animes i explain why i love and relate to this. Shinji like myself not too long ago is afraid to interact with people because he might get hurt, this is called Hedgehogs Dilemna. I believe if you cant relate to him on that level then you wont fully appreciate how Anno (creator) wrote Shinji. This is the truth about humans. He was abandoned by both parents, his mother (bleep), his father makes him move in with his teacher. Then at the start of the show is called by his father who he hates to pilot the Eva. Shinji came for his father but ended up staying to pilot the Eva in place of an injured Rei. He doesnt like piloting but sometimes he says he does it because everyone likes him for it. Selfless. Imagine if after so many years your father calls you to pilot a giant ass robot instead of reconnecting with you. I'd be scared! People say that is a point of where they dislike him. He wont pilot but he does the first time and whenever he runs he comes back.&-&So you literally saying I can control mecha too&-&<:PokemonUmbreonWhat:680078108044689419>&-&Hes not a objectively bad protagonist. Your opinion is subjective&-&This is a debate. I can get aggressive, right?&-&yes&-&As long as I stay objective of course&-&Yes theres people in real life who are like shinji and theres nothing in this world thats all positivity&-&If you feel like I'm subjective please do say&-&> So you literally saying I can control mecha too
<@!585644054352756741> this proves you didnt read my comment&-&hmm&-&the comment was too long not even me read it all&-&Bruh he didn't get it&-&Well&-&Moe-Allen&-&Oh ok&-&Firstly shinji is a really relatable character. Depression and question of identity is something that many teenagers go through right now. It is actually a breath of fresh air if MC is not conventional but relatable. And he didn't come back by himself. He was brought back. Yeah he is afraid of interacting and getting hurt. But even so it's not shown that yes even he can get over it. Sure he was abandoned by his father. That's precisely why he piloted Eva. He wanted his acknowledgement. Not selflessly. Even then his father doesn't like him.&-&He is always shown delving into himself. He was afraid of people and didn't really wanted to save people selflessly.&-&Ehh?&-&No answer&-&He got defeated&-&<:YGPansySmile:650243647568347136>&-&Naisu&-&Fok!!! My net is so slow&-&Discord disconnects with every msg&-&<@456226577798135808> sorry if we hit a nerve. You are entitled to your opinion and I to mine. Some aspects of shinji's character are indeed good. But at the end they are not resolved. He is almost the same person as when the show started.&-&hmm&-&You seen neon genesis?&-&> <@456226577798135808> sorry if we hit a nerve. You are entitled to your opinion and I to mine. Some aspects of shinji's character are indeed good. But at the end they are not resolved. He is almost the same person as when the show started.
<@!557168803293691937> i respect your opinion too. But heres one thing characters like people change if they want too. Shinji is the same person from day one but that doesnt mean his character is bad.&-&Bruh&-&So you are saying shinji is fine the way he is?&-&No character development amounts to a bad show&-&> Bruh
<@!557168803293691937> yes because like i said there are characters who dont change and they can be interesting as those who do like shinji becuase its his conviction on his characters unwillingness to change&-&That's not unwillingness or unshakeable belief in himself but indecisiveness and cowardice&-&And he himself knows it&-&<:YGsip:661340278548070414>&-&> That's not unwillingness or unshakeable belief in himself but indecisiveness and cowardice
<@!557168803293691937>  okay and your point on my pervious comment. Theres differences between characterization and development. Characertization is learning more about the way they act and sometimes justifiable. And devlopment is perspective depening lives enough to change. Not the mere fact they change. So thats my standard. And NGE isnt meant to have just having character development, youre not supposed to take the characters too seriously. Its fine to dislike them but you have to understand thats its a life about depression. So thats what you dont get. And you dont have to agree with me. Im just stating my point of how it is.&-&Sorry. I really can't agree.&-&Sorry forget that&-&> Sorry. I really can't agree.
<@!557168803293691937> well yes thats the whole point of the show&-&And it should be given in a realistic way, right?&-&The depression stuff I mean&-&> And it should be given in a realistic way, right?
<@!557168803293691937> well yes and thats what the show plays it in a mature way&-&Then for me it doesn't do a good job on realism&-&And i dont agree but hey people have their own subjective opinions&-&There are better manga and anime out there do it better. At least for me.&-&Well let's put and end to this debate, shall we?&-&Shinji is a curious character no doubt but for me it's not resolved the way his character deserved.

Maybe I am not able to see it the way you do and connect to it. And it is entirely fine.&-&Well everything is subjective&-&Even God himself&-&Yep&-&Good talk bro&-&Thanks for sharing your opinions&-&Well lets chat more bro&-&Sure&-&It's night and I'm bored so why not&-&> Sure

They have doors. Doors to other worlds. If they wished you could get sucked into that unique world. And unless you solve a puzzle or quest or  something you will be trapped in there.

I don't know how you want to plagiarize it. Story, or world or some aspects only.

But abduction of your beloved would be cliché now a days.
Rama was a self sacrificing character. Which is a little akeen to Saber's character. And Rama is a king that Gilgamesh would despise.

Most interesting one to take from Ramayana into modern novel would be Rawan as...how do I put it....anti-villain I guess.&-&<@556157454623309835>&-&I meant his life's most significant events and the characters that he encounters which leave a long lasting impact on him.

Ye he's smart but he can't literally solve anything without money&-&<:YGShrug:661340423679377454>&-&Not worth calling a detective&-&He just buying the information not gathering it himself&-&And without those complicated gadgets thingy he's just a normal arrogant rich man thats all&-&but batman is like that too&-&Ye but Batman don't call himself a detective&-&hmm&-&tru&-&but buying information takes time too&-&Basically daisuke can't solve a case without money
That same goes to Batman
Without his gadgets he's not strong&-&to get the accurate info&-&If I put it in a simple way:
**Without money he is not worthy**&-&<:YGShrug:661340423679377454>&-&but i still ship kato and daisuke&-&Well I don't basically hate the anime but it just irritates me that he keeps relying on money&-&Ye basically that's it&-&yah&-&but the episode he ran away from home and was without money was good&-&Well my review is:
It's a good mystery solving series but not good psychological type&-&yah&-&Because you need to use brains for that
But he use gadgets so its kinda boring&-&psycological stories should be like COTE&-&Sorry <@557168803293691937> 
I think millionaire detective mc is suck lol&-&yah&-&> psycological stories should be like COTE
Agree&-&kato sucks&-&I think the point was it being not realistic&-&but sadly good anime gets only one season&-&Psychological aspect was never there&-&No actually sanj I'm quite ok with it not being realistic
The problem is it's all focus on money&-&its showing the power of money&-&It's in the title so&-&<:YGShrug:661340423679377454>&-&They should call it 
**Money Mystery Solving Rich Man**&-&Lol&-&Welp&-&It was fun to watch&-&I didn't focus on much else&-&it was not that good but was fun&-&Well ye
Maybe its not just my type of mystery&-&It's too easy to predict ngl&-&which anime do you think will get the top spot of fall season?&-&This season?&-&Hmmm&-&yes&-&mine is jujutsu kaisen&-&Probably **Kamisama ni Natta Hi**
Since it's from jun maeda&-&And a lot of fans is expecting great things on it too&-&yah im watching that one too and its good&-&Yeppp&-&Jun maeda&-&One of my favourites&-&and gojou is op&-&If not maybe danmachi or mahouka no rettosei&-&yah&-&Jujutsu Kaisen is pretty great when it comes to production but in the end it's just another shounen&-&Again&-&Yeah&-&then maybe mahouka will win&-&since everyone was waiting for it&-&Though I still like shounen&-&Ye I'm one of them waiting for it&-&i only like good shounen anime&-&Ofc&-&I don't like black clover&-&i just need no game no life season 2 and i will be ssatisfied&-&Well I'm not gonna be shocked if jujutsu Kaisen became popular
Shounen is just to hype this days cause of kny&-&i dont like the black clover filler arc&-&Kny is good. I'll be honest&-&But it doesn't deserve the attention it got&-&and demon slayer infinity train movie released too&-&Naruto>boruto>fairy tale>black clover
Suck shits&-&I mean it sold more than 95 million in a year&-&There's so many masterpiece that deserves more attention than kny&-&Sed&-&like komi san&-&Naruto is one of the best shounen. I still go back to it&-&Nah&-&DBZ for me
I don't watch it anymore tho&-&hmm&-&Cuz while it being shounen it has great tragedies&-&So naruto is best for me&-&i think mine is no game no life&-&Hunter x hunter is my favourite too but it's kinda unique even though being shounen&-&i wanted the season 2 even more after i watched the movie&-&It's hard to rank anime&-&Just read novel i guess&-&Hhmm&-&> It's hard to rank anime

Have a lot of volumes in jp that still untranslated so its easy
While cote is still publishing duh&-&No only one&-&Vol 16&-&Then they probably will do that as soon as possible&-&I'm talking about all other LN though&-&They all like scheduled&-&Ye
What do you think that
"Yey new LN release"
Tommorow:
"Yey the new LN have an English now"&-&It's not easy lol&-&No I don't mean..... Baaaka&-&I mean&-&Like 
Oct 6 novel A novel B
Oct 13 novel D novel E
Oct 19 novel F novel G&-&They release schedule like this before&-&Then follow schedule&-&Except grimgar&-&I mean cote&-&Not grimgar&-&Fvck I'm messing up names&-&Ah
That's what you meant
Then that means those LN is already translated
All they do now is publish it&-&<:YGShrug:661340423679377454>&-&Simple.&-&O soukka soukka&-&Or not&-&They don't do whole&-&Like part 1 part 2 part 3 of each LN&-&Each Month&-&They upload in schedule&-&And in end they upload whole 1 day after the last part&-&*sigh*
Those LN is special case 
It's all dangerous if it copyrighted&-&And don't expect only one team doing it
Botman is not part of jnovels translation groub&-&They do the translation on their own&-&Here&-&Like these&-&O soukka&-&Bruh.... that's official releases and just pirate it so you can release it online

Jnovels have a translation group
But that doesn't mean all the LN they publish online is from them
It's s official translations
And all jnovels do is pirate it so they can share it online&-&So LN series like cote and grimgar that's not licensed
They can't release it boldly
